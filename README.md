# My Portfolio

Welcome to my React-powered portfolio! This is where I showcase my projects, experiments, and occasional coding disasters. Built with React, Tailwind CSS, and a dash of curiosity.

## ✨ Features

- **React Components**: Clean, reusable, and interactive.
- **Dark & Light Themes**: Switch based on your mood.
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- **Animations & Interactivity**: Subtle but fun touches for a dynamic feel.
- **Video Project Previews**: Autoplaying muted video demos for projects.
- **Animated Skills Badges**: Tech stack displayed as interactive pill badges.
- **Shimmering Footer**: Unique animated footer with gradient effects.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- React 18
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion
- lucide-react & react-icons

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

### Preview Production Build

```bash
npm run preview

## 🎥 Adding Project Videos

Place your project demo videos in `public/videos/` and reference them in `Projects.tsx`. Make sure videos are optimized for web (short length, reasonable bitrate) for quick loading.

## 🎨 Customization

- **Colors & Spacing**: Modify Tailwind classes directly in components
- **Animations**: Custom keyframes are defined in `App.css`
- **Content**: Update project data, skills, and personal info in respective component files

## 📦 Deployment

This portfolio works great on:
- Vercel
- Netlify
- GitHub Pages
- Any static hosting service

Simply build the project and deploy the `dist/` directory.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [ ] Add blog section with MDX support
- [ ] Implement project filtering by tech stack
- [ ] Add contact form with backend integration
- [ ] Create more micro-interactions
- [ ] Add loading animations

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I love learning by building. My projects range from small experiments to full-fledged apps, and I'm always iterating. When I'm not coding, I'm probably hunting for snacks, arguing with my plants, or testing how many cups of coffee are too many.
