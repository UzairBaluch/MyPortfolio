# My React Portfolio

Welcome to my React-powered portfolio! This is where I showcase my projects, experiments, and occasional coding disasters. Built with React, Tailwind CSS, and a dash of curiosity.

## Features

- **React Components:** Clean, reusable, and interactive.
- **Dark & Light Themes:** Switch based on your mood.
- **Responsive Design:** Works perfectly on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- **Animations & Interactivity:** Subtle but fun touches for a dynamic feel.

## About Me

I love learning by building. My projects range from small experiments to full-fledged apps, and I’m always iterating. When I’m not coding, I’m probably hunting for snacks, arguing with my plants, or testing how many cups of coffee are too many.
